About the Hackathon
The challenge at hand revolves around the creation of a sophisticated predictive model aimed at determining the likelihood of an individual having heart disease. As one of the leading causes of global mortality, detecting heart disease in its early stages is pivotal for enhancing patient outcomes and halting its progression. Conventional diagnostic methods often come with substantial costs and time requirements. Thus, there exists a pressing need for a cutting-edge predictive model that can evaluate the risk of heart disease utilizing easily accessible patient information.

The Objective
The objective of this challenge is to design and build a predictive model capable of accurately determining the probability of an individual having heart disease. The focus is on leveraging machine learning techniques to create a model that can analyze relevant features and provide reliable predictions. The model should demonstrate high accuracy and generalizability, ensuring its effectiveness on new, unseen data.
